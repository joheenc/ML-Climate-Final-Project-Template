Feb 05: I began the process of data gathering. While the specific question I want to answer is not fully formulated yet, I decided to begin anyway with hopes that as I began exploring the data, something interesting would come to mind. I am sourcing energy data from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/) and climate-related data (temperatures, cloud cover, wind conditions, etc.) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Data Online tool (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web). For now, I am just exploring the various data columns available and examining their plots in Jupyter notebooks.
