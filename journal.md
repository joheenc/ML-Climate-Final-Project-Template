Feb 05: I began the process of data gathering. While the specific question I want to answer is not fully formulated yet, I decided to begin anyway with hopes that as I began exploring the data, something interesting would come to mind. I am sourcing energy data from the US Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/) and climate-related data (temperatures, cloud cover, wind conditions, etc.) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Data Online tool (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web). For now, I am just exploring the various data columns available and examining their plots in Jupyter notebooks.

Feb 12: I have a clearer idea of what I want to work on now: identifying whether there exists a measurable anthropogenic impact on the variability of Earth's atmospheric spectra. I spent most of yesterday doing literature review to this end, and found these articles most useful:
* https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40641-016-0039-5.pdf : review article covering work done in the domain of spectroscopic measurements of Earth's Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and Reflected Shortwave (RSW).
* https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2004JD005530 : PCA of OLR from AIRS early 2000s data; identified that 95% of variability in atmospheric spectra could be attributed to a few traceable PCs linked with specific environmental processes
* https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/3133/2013/acp-13-3133-2013.pdf : a similar analysis of RSW data using data from the SCIAMACHY spectrometer
There are a few articles like this finding various dimensionality reduction techniques are useful in isolating spectral variance to climate trends across spatial and temporal regions. I want to see if some small fraction of the variance can be correlated with human behavior--energy production/consumption by spatial region, for example--to see if there is a traceable impact on atmospheric gas composition.

I've started acquiring public data from the SCIAMACHY instrument, and I'm spending some time learning the custom data analysis environment the European Space Agency provides for processing and analysis of their atmospheric spectra. Hopefully afterwards it becomes straightforward to bulk-process the ~decade worth of data and start experimenting with some dimensionality reduction techniques.

I'm now able to use the ESA-provided Python APIs to reduce, calibrate, and visualize SCIAMACHY spectra. However, I'm seeing strange data artifacts with unphysical spectral ranges, which is likely related to some shortcoming in how I'm calibrating the data. This was good progress, though; once I figure out how to properly calibrate the spectra, the next step will be to amass a large quantity of them and then I can start doing some preliminary PCA.
